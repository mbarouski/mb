# My web pages

- `jekyll` - Jekyll implementation of my pages
- `docs` - Jekyll build used in GitHub Pages and for deployment to Surge
- `base64-webpage` - simple HTML page in base64 string which can be opened in browser
- `vue` - Vue implementation of my website (deprecated since Vue is too much for my pages requirements)

## TODOs

1. Implement continuous deployment to Surge as described [here](https://surge.sh/help/deploying-continuously-using-git-hooks);
2. Implement main page as a bookshelf with a photo in frame on WebGL;
3. Implement desktop icon as a web component;
